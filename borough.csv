"Note: The average net completions (new units minus demolished units) of housing over a three-year period. 
Averaging over this period helps to account for significant fluctations in completions over time. 
The 'Affordable, social and other discouted' category includes social, affordable and intermediate rented housing and other discounted properties such as starter homes. 
More information is available in the csv document. The London Plan has annual target for the number of homes Planning Authorities should complete each year. 
For most of London, the boroughs act as Planning Authority. The London Legacy Development Corporation is the Planning Authority for the area surrounding the 
Olympic Park in East London. The Old Oak Park Royal Development Corporation is a newly-created body that will serve at the Planning Authority for the area around 
Old Oak Common in West London.",,,
